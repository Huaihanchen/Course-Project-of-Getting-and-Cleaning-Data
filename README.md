 Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera

This repository contains the R code and documents required by the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" in the "Data Scientist" of Coursera.

run_analysis.R is the code to perform the required analyses. To run the code, all the data should be uncompressed and in the same folder with no names changed.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

averageData.txt is the result of the final analysis.
